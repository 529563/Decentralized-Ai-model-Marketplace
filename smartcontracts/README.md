# Dataset Marketplace Smart Contract

## Overview
The `DatasetMarketplace` smart contract allows users to upload, buy, and sell datasets stored on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). Datasets can be listed for sale with a price set by their owners, and buyers can purchase these datasets by transferring Ether (ETH) to the dataset's owner. The contract ensures secure ownership transfers, updates prices, and includes various security features to protect the interactions.

## Features
- **Upload datasets**: Users can upload datasets by providing the IPFS hash and setting a price.
- **Buy datasets**: Users can purchase datasets using ETH, transferring ownership upon payment.
- **Manage datasets**: Dataset owners can update prices or relist their datasets for sale.
- **Security**: The contract uses OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` and `ReentrancyGuard` contracts to ensure access control and prevent reentrancy attacks.

## Contract Components

### 1. **Dataset Structure**
Each dataset in the marketplace is represented by the following structure:
```solidity
struct Dataset {
    uint256 id;          // Unique identifier for the dataset
    string ipfsHash;     // IPFS hash for the dataset storage
    address payable owner; // Address of the dataset owner (can receive payments)
    uint256 price;       // Price of the dataset in Wei (1 Ether = 10^18 Wei)
    bool isForSale;      // Indicates whether the dataset is currently listed for sale
}
```

### 2. **Mapping and Counters**
- `mapping(uint256 => Dataset) public datasets`: This mapping stores all datasets, with their unique ID as the key.
- `uint256 public datasetCount`: This counter tracks the number of datasets uploaded to the marketplace, providing a unique ID for each dataset.

### 3. **Events**
Events are emitted when certain actions occur in the contract:
- `DatasetUploaded(uint256 indexed id, string ipfsHash, uint256 price)`: Emitted when a new dataset is uploaded.
- `DatasetPurchased(uint256 indexed id, address indexed buyer, address indexed seller, uint256 price)`: Emitted when a dataset is purchased.
- `PriceUpdated(uint256 indexed id, uint256 newPrice)`: Emitted when a dataset owner updates the price.
- `DatasetListed(uint256 indexed id, uint256 price)`: Emitted when a dataset is relisted for sale by its owner.

### 4. **Modifiers**
The contract includes a custom modifier to restrict access to specific functions:
```solidity
modifier onlyDatasetOwner(uint256 _id) {
    require(datasets[_id].owner == msg.sender, "Caller is not the dataset owner");
    _;
}
```
This modifier ensures that only the owner of a dataset can call certain functions, such as updating the price or relisting the dataset for sale.

### 5. **Constructor**
The contract constructor sets up the contract by assigning the deployer (`msg.sender`) as the contract owner via OpenZeppelin’s `Ownable` constructor:
```solidity
constructor() Ownable(msg.sender) { }
```

### 6. **Functions**

#### a. `uploadDataset(string memory _ipfsHash, uint256 _price)`
This function allows a user to upload a new dataset by specifying the IPFS hash and the price for which the dataset will be sold. It increments the dataset count and adds the dataset to the mapping.
```solidity
function uploadDataset(string memory _ipfsHash, uint256 _price) external;
```
- Requires the IPFS hash to be non-empty.
- Requires the price to be greater than zero.
- Emits the `DatasetUploaded` event.

#### b. `buyDataset(uint256 _id)`
This function allows users to buy a dataset listed for sale. The buyer sends ETH (in Wei) equal to or greater than the dataset’s price. Upon successful purchase, ownership is transferred, and the seller receives the payment.
```solidity
function buyDataset(uint256 _id) external payable nonReentrant;
```
- Requires the dataset to be listed for sale.
- Requires the buyer to send sufficient payment.
- Prevents the owner from buying their own dataset.
- Uses `nonReentrant` to prevent reentrancy attacks.
- Emits the `DatasetPurchased` event.

#### c. `updatePrice(uint256 _id, uint256 _newPrice)`
Dataset owners can update the price of their dataset using this function.
```solidity
function updatePrice(uint256 _id, uint256 _newPrice) external onlyDatasetOwner(_id);
```
- Requires the caller to be the dataset owner.
- Requires the new price to be greater than zero.
- Emits the `PriceUpdated` event.

#### d. `listDatasetForSale(uint256 _id, uint256 _price)`
This function allows dataset owners to relist their dataset for sale by setting a new price.
```solidity
function listDatasetForSale(uint256 _id, uint256 _price) external onlyDatasetOwner(_id);
```
- Requires the caller to be the dataset owner.
- Requires the price to be greater than zero.
- Marks the dataset as available for sale.
- Emits the `DatasetListed` event.

#### e. `getDataset(uint256 _id)`
This function allows anyone to retrieve the details of a dataset by providing its unique ID. It returns the `Dataset` struct for the corresponding dataset.
```solidity
function getDataset(uint256 _id) external view returns (Dataset memory);
```

## Security Features
- **Access Control**: The contract uses OpenZeppelin’s `Ownable` to restrict ownership-related actions and the `onlyDatasetOwner` modifier to prevent unauthorized access to dataset management functions.
- **Reentrancy Protection**: By using the `ReentrancyGuard` from OpenZeppelin, the contract protects against reentrancy attacks, especially in functions where ETH is transferred (e.g., `buyDataset`).
  
## Usage
1. **Upload Dataset**: Call the `uploadDataset` function with the IPFS hash and price.
2. **Buy Dataset**: Buyers can purchase datasets by calling the `buyDataset` function and sending ETH.
3. **Manage Dataset**: Owners can update the price and relist their datasets for sale.
